          Mimic Farms is developing a perennial polyculture Agroforestry system
          in Northport, Michigan that is intented to imitate the
          Beech-Maple-Basswood plant community native to our region.
          <br />
          <br />
          We are primarily growing Hybrid Hazelnuts and Chinese Chestnuts which
          are related to the Beech (Fagaceae) and Amerian Hop Hornbeam
          (Betulaceae) family of trees that thrive abundantley in the soil
          surrounding our property. Additionally we are testing a small planting
          of Paw Paw, to assess its growth and adaptability within our area.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our focus is to use solutions that mimic nature on a hyper-local level
          to establish and ecologically resiliant system that helps promote soil
          health, increases biodiversity, and regeneratively produces high
          yields of nutrient dense food.
